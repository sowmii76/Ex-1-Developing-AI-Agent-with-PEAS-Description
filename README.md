# Ex-1-Developing-AI-Agent-with-PEAS-Description
### Name: SOWMIYA G

### Register Number: 2305002023

### Aim:
To find the PEAS description for the given AI problem and develop an AI agent.

### Theory :
PEAS stands for:
'''
P-Performance measure

E-Environment

A-Actuators

S-Sensors
'''

It’s a framework used to define the task environment for an AI agent clearly.

### Pick an AI Problem

```

1. Self-driving car

2. Chess playing agent

3. Vacuum cleaning robot

4. Email spam filter

5. Personal assistant (like Siri or Alexa)
```

### VacuumCleanerAgent
### Algorithm:
Step 1: Initialize:

Set agent’s location to A

Set environment dirt status for locations A and B (True = dirty, False = clean)

Step 2 :Repeat until all locations are clean (no dirt):
a. Sense if current location has dirt
b. If current location has dirt:
- Suck dirt (set dirt status at current location to False)
c. Else:
- If current location is A, move right to location B
- Else if current location is B, move left to location A
d. Print the agent’s current location and dirt status (optional for debugging)

Step 3: Stop when all locations are clean

Step 4: Print total steps taken (optional)

### Program:
```
class VacuumCleanerAgent:
def __init__(self):
# Initialize the agent's state (location and dirt status)
self.location = "A" # Initial location (can be "A" or "B")
self.dirt_status = {"A": False, "B": False} # Initial dirt
status (False means no dirt)
def move_left(self):
# Move the agent to the left if possible
if self.location == "B":
self.location = "A"
def move_right(self):
# Move the agent to the right if possible
if self.location == "A":
self.location = "B"
def suck_dirt(self):
# Suck dirt in the current location if there is dirt
if self.dirt_status[self.location]:
self.dirt_status[self.location] = False
print(f"Sucked dirt in location {self.location}")
def do_nothing(self):
# Do nothing
pass
def perform_action(self, action):
# Perform the specified action
if action == "left":
self.move_left()
elif action == "right":
self.move_right()
elif action == "suck":
self.suck_dirt()
elif action == "nothing":
self.do_nothing()
else:
print("Invalid action")
def print_status(self):
# Print the current status of the agent
print(f"Location: {self.location}, Dirt Status:
{self.dirt_status}")
# Example usage:
agent = VacuumCleanerAgent()
# Move the agent, suck dirt, and do nothing
agent.perform_action("left")
agent.print_status()
agent.perform_action("suck")
agent.print_status()
agent.perform_action("nothing")
agent.print_status()
```
### Sample Output:

![af840d01-239c-45fd-b9bf-8a8113ad7df2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e0c0496-d387-4cd7-aead-ebb974b9546d)


### Result:
Thus, the PEAS description for a Personal Assistant Al agent was identified and a
working Al agent program was successfully developed.
